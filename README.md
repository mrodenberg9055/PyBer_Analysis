# PyBer_Analysis

## PyBer Fares Analysis

- The pupose of this analysis was to take the driver and city data that we were given and come up with some insights for V. Isualize. 
  - First, we'll take the driver data and summarize it into a dataframe showing key KPIs broken down by the city types
  - Next, we'll take a subset of the ride logs, break it into weekly buckets and write the results to a line graph to easily see the results 

## Results

- After reviewing the data that we pulled together there are some very noticable differences in key metrics
  - The average driver for the Rural rides makes just over $34 per ride, which breaks down to just over and average of $8 per driver.  
  - Although the urban fares as a whole are much higher than the other types, the average fare per ride is about $10 per ride lower than the rural rides and about $6 lower than the suburban rides.  
  - There are also significantly more drivers in the urban areas making the average fare per driver very low. 

- Below are the other results from the analysis

## Summary

- Right now there are so many drivers in the Urban areas and very few in the Rural areas.  Figuring out a way to get some of those drivers to work the rural areas could help them increase the amout of money they are making on each ride, but also increase the number of rides coming from rural areas.  
- I would also like to potentially see how much we are spending on marketing in the rural areas and see how that correlates to the number of rides.  If we can increase the budget in those areas and it leads to more riders, it might be worth reviewing.  
- Lastly I would like to know how long people are waiting for drivers to get there, and how that correlates to number of drivers in the area. If we see that riders are discouraged by long wait times, or potentially cancelling rides because there are no drivers in the area then we could pivot to giving drivers more incentive to drive in those areas.
